# PairTrade Application Analysis

## Overview
This is a sophisticated financial trading platform built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript, specifically designed for **pairs trading** and **statistical arbitrage**. The application helps traders identify, analyze, and backtest market-neutral trading opportunities using advanced statistical methods.

## What is Pairs Trading?
Pairs trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that involves:
- Taking simultaneous long and short positions in two correlated securities
- Profiting from the convergence of price spreads when securities deviate from their historical relationship
- Hedging against market risk by being market-neutral

## Core Features

### 1. **Statistical Analysis Tools**
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies highly correlated stock pairs
- **Cointegration Testing**: Determines if two stocks have a long-term equilibrium relationship
- **Z-Score Calculation**: Measures how far the current spread deviates from the mean
- **OLS Regression**: Calculates optimal hedge ratios between paired securities

### 2. **Advanced Backtesting Capabilities**
The platform offers multiple backtesting approaches:
- **Ratio Backtest** (`backtest.tsx`): Tests traditional ratio-based pair trading strategies
- **Spread Backtest** (`backtest-spread.tsx`): Analyzes spread-based trading strategies
- **Euclidean Distance Backtest** (`backtest-euclidean.tsx`): Uses Euclidean distance for pair selection
- **Kalman Filter Backtest** (`backtest-kalman.tsx`): Employs Kalman filtering for dynamic hedge ratio estimation
